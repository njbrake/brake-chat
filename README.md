# Brake Chat

This is a fork of https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui that has been heavily modified.

1. Custom branding (BrakeChat)
2. Removal of all unused features and legacy code
3. New features as I see necessary

It's also sort of an experiment in using Claude Code/Cursor/AI Assisted coding to heavily modify a codebase.
I'd like to see how much I can clean up the project and customize it to my own purposes, sped along using AI tools.

## Note on Licensing

OpenWebUi has done amazing work. Their license permits this because I am using it for fewer than 50 people. If you plan to use this
at an organization level, reach out to them for information about enterprise licensing.
